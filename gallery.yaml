  Our project is a puzzle game where you place Tetris-like
  blocks in a grid, clearing lines to earn points. The goal of the
  game is to strategically place the blocks to clear rows and columns
  in an efficient manner, as the game is over when you can no longer
  place any of your blocks in the grid. The blocks ramp in difficulty
  over time, so be careful!

  Supports standard visual I/O using drag and drop.

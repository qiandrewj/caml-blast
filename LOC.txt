The module implementations `playEasyState.ml/.mli` and `playHardState.ml/.mli` contain much of the same code,
and are mostly used to add slightly modified game experiences for the user. Our codebase's lines of code meets
the target even excluding one of these modules, so if needed for testing LoC, either one can be excluded. Thank you!
